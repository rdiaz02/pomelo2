<B>(Or, for old-time Pomelo users: Why you should switch to Pomelo II)</B>

<p>Pomelo II is a new and much improved incarnation of Pomelo, a tool
for finding differentially expressed genes, and genes that are of
potential interest because they are related to an outcome of interest
(e.g., type of cancer, survival).
</p>

<p>The main features that differentiate Pomelo II from its ancestor,
Pomelo, are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Much faster than Pomelo. The underlying C++ code has now been
    parallelized for the permutation computations. For the longer problems
    you can expect up to a 40 to 60 fold increase in speed. Whenever you run
    Pomelo II you will be using between 60 and 66 CPUs simultaneously.
</li>


<li>Customizable heatmaps for the results that include a dendrogram of the displayed
    genes. This allows "similar genes" to be grouped together in the figures, thus
    simplifying interpretation.  You select the genes to plot based on different criteria
    (unadjusted p-value, FDR-adjusted p-value, ...). 
</li>


<li>If you use any of the currently standard identifiers for your gene
IDs for either human, mouse, or rat genomes, you can obtain additional
information by clicking on the names in the output tables and
figures. This information is based on that provided by our <a 
href="http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter</a> tool.</li>


<li>Tables of results are now sortable according to different
criteria (unadjusted p-value, FDR-adjusted p-value, ...).</li>

<li>New non-permutation methods have been added (t-limma, anova-limma and paired
t-limma).</li>
<li>It is now possible to add more covariables (for t-limma and anova-limma). 
That is, you can now add more information, such as: subject age, country, or any 
other characteristic that might vary expression data.</li>
<li>We now only provide FDR-adjusted p-values (see below).</li>
</ul>

     <a name=toc3>FDR and adjusted p-values</a>  
</div>
<div id = "results" class = "results_box" >
<br>
<div class = "actual_text">
<p> So as to control multiple testing effects, we provide FDR-adjusted p-values, which we calculate 
using the approach of <b>Benjamini & Hochberg</b> (1995; J. Royal Statistical Society B, 57:289-300).
FWER-correction is no longer provided. We think that control of the FDR (False Discovery Rate) is 
probably more relevant for most genomic and proteomics research than control of the FWER
(Family-Wise Error Rate); in addition, use of the maxT FWER control procedure requires 
that the subset pivotality assumption holds, which is not the case with some of the 
tests available in Pomelo.</p>

<p>Finally, even if the assumptions of the Benjamini and Hochberg's
FDR procedure are not satistified, the error is often small (Reiner, A., D. Yekutieli, and 
Y. Benjamini, 2003, "Identifying differentially expressed genes using false discovery rate 
controlling procedures", Bioinformatics 19, 368-375) and, overall, this method is competitive 
to other alternatives such as Benjamini & Yekutieli's or permutation-based approaches.

    <h3><a name=toc5><a name="t.test">t-test (Permutations)</a></a></h3>
    <p>The all-famous t-test. Used to compare an interval variable (one where
       distances between levels make sense) between two groups. For example, we could compare
       gene expression data between two types of patients. We use here the test statistic for
       the case where we do not assume equal variances in the two groups. This test is a 
       permutation test.
    </p>
      
    <h3><a name=toc6><a name="Anova">Anova (Permutations)</a></a></h3>
    <p>Analysis of variance. We compare between more than two groups the value of an interval
       data. For example, the gene expression among five types of cancer. This test is a 
       permutation test.
    </p>
    <h3><a name=toc7><a name="Regression">Regression (Permutations)</a></a></h3>
    <p>Linear regression. We try to predict the (interval scaled) values of a dependent
       variable based on the values of an independent, interval scaled variable. A typical example
       is predicting the expression levels of a protein using gene expression data.
       This test is a permutation test.
    </p>
    <h3><a name=toc8><a name="contigency.table">FisherIxJ</a></a></h3>
    <p>Non permutation method for contingency tables. It obtains the unadjusted p-value using Fisher's exact
       test. This test would be the one to use if we have, say, different classes of patients (e.g.,
       six types of cancers) and for a set of 1000 markers we can have either presence/absence of each 
       marker in each patient (this would yield 1000 contingency tables of dimensions 6x2 ---each 
       marker by each cancer type), or we can have several levels of (unordered) expression, 
       say four types of expression (which would yield 1000 6x4 tables).
    </p>
    <p>If the markers have more than two levels of expression and these are ordered (say, 
       from less to more) other tests could be more powerful, such as the Cochran-Armitage test 
       (which we have not yet implemented). Another alternative with categorical response data are
       logistic and multinomial models (which we are in the process of implementing).
    </p>
    <h3><a name=toc9><a name="Cox">Cox model</a></a></h3>
    <p>A widely used model for survival data. With survival data we often have censored
       observations (e.g., a patient that is not yet dead, and all we know is that it lived for at
       least 100 days after initiation of the treatment).
    </p>
    <p>Currently, the Cox model included here works with interval-scaled covariates; if you pass it a 
       categorical covariate, it can ONLY have two possible values; otherwise, you will get meaningless
       results (it will be treated as an interval scaled covariate).
    </p>
    <p>The Cox model implemented only works with right-censored observations, not left-censored or 
       doubly-censored ones. As well, it is of course your responsibility to make sure that assumptions 
       about censoring (e.g., lifetimes and censoring times are independent, etc) are reasonable.
    </p>
    <h3><a name=toc10><a name="t-test (limma)">t-test (limma)</a></a></h3>
    <p>The limma t-test is a non-permutation method used to compare gene expression data between two 
       groups.
    </p>
    <p>All three limma tests included assume gene distribution to be gaussian. This condition
       is fairly reasonable, but <i>gene merging will disrupt this condition</i> thus invalidating 
       limma tests results. As well as this, when performing a test on one particular gene limma 
       tests borrow information from all the other genes.
    </p>

    <h3><a name=toc11><a name="Paired t-test (limma)">Paired t-test (limma)</a></a></h3>
    <p>This test is the same test as the limma t-test, but allows us to extract common expression 
       data from paired samples thus allowing for a much finer comparison. 
    </p>
    <p><i>Eg.</i> Suppose we want to perform a t-test to compare tumor vs non-tumor samples 
       from the same subjects. Each of the samples belonging to the same person should contain very 
       similar expression data and therefore can be considered as paired. By using a paired limma 
       t-test we should obtain far better results due to the fact that these similarities will 
       be accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>All three limma tests included assume gene distribution to be gaussian. This condition
       is fairly reasonable, but <i>gene merging will disrupt this condition</i> thus invalidating 
       limma tests results. As well as this, when performing a test on one particular gene limma 
       tests borrow information from all the other genes.
    </p>
 

    <h3><a name=toc12><a name="Anova, linear models (limma)">Anova, linear models (limma)</a></a></h3>
    <p>Non permutation method used to compare gene expression data between more than two groups. 
    </p>
    <p>Additionaly, once the test results have been calculated, this method gives us the option
       to individually compare classes (t-test) and draw venn diagrams with the class comparisons.
    </p>
    <p>All three limma tests included assume gene distribution to be gaussian. This condition
       is fairly reasonable, but <i>gene merging will disrupt this condition</i> thus invalidating 
       limma tests results. As well as this, when performing a test on one particular gene limma 
       tests borrow information from all the other genes.

<br>
<div class = "actual_text">
<p>What Pomelo tries to do is "detect" genes that are different using
   as a criteria, gene expression data difference among two or more
   classes. Since <i>most likely our data is not homogeneous
   </i> (homogeneous meaning all subjects of the same age, country,
   ... ), we may find that the differences due to different classes
   are "blurred" by other differences.  By using additional covariables, 
   we can add this information to our study and thus enable a more complete
   analysis. 
</p>
<p>Although additional covariables can be very useful, if the covariable you try 
   to add is the same as the class file, pomelo can do nothing with this.
   <i>Eg.</i> If you are comparing two classes and you add a covariable 
   indicating that all subjects of one class are male and all subjects of 
   the other are female, pomelo has no way of knowing which differences belong 
   to the covariable and which to the class difference.
</p>
<p>Additional covariables can only be used with "t-test (limma)" and "Anova, 
   linear models (limma)".

       certain tests are: <i>"Censored indicator file"</i> (Cox test), <i>"Paired indicator file"</i>
       (paired t-test) and <i>"Additional covariables file"</i> (optional for both

	say, survival (e.g., Cox model).</dd>

      <dt><br><a name="class.labels">Class labels</a> or dependent

      <dd> 
        This file is only necessary for paired t-test. It is used to indicate which subjects

    </dl>

    <h3><a name=toc17><a name="requirements">Data format for gene expression data</a></a></h3>
    <p> The file for the gene expression should be formated as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data should conform to the "genes in rows, patients (or classes) in columns".
	  In other words, each row of the data file is supposed to represent a different gene
	  or variable and we will carry-out <b>one test for each row</b>.</li>
      <li>Use tab (\t) as the field separator within rows.</li>
      <li>Use newline (\n) between rows. It is also convenient to finish each
	      file with one (\n).</li>
      <li>The first column is assumed to contain the ID information for genes, marker,
	or whatever. This will be used to label the output (but it also means that whatever is
	in the first column is not used in the analyses).</li>
      <li>You can have an arbitrary number of rows with comments. These rows must always start
	with an "#".</li>
      <li>Array names: if you want to name your arrays (useful for the output of
	the analyses) do as follows:
	<ol>
	  <li>Place a line that starts with "&#035;";</li>
	  <li>After the "&#035;" put "Name" or "NAME" or "name" (don't say we
	    don't give you choices);</li>
	  <li>Write the array names (separated by tabs).</li>
	</ol>

      <li>There should be no rows with non-numeric data (except for
	  the comments and name rows). In particular,
	  eliminate initial rows that contain things such as headers with the IDs of
	  patients.</li>

      <li><b>Missing values</b> can be coded in three different ways: a) as "NA"; b) with one 
	  empty space (i.e., " "); c) as nothing (i.e, simply leave these places empty).</li>
      <li> This is a small covariate data file using "NA" for missing values:
	<div class="color">
	  <pre>
gene1	 23.4	45.6	NA	76	85.6
genW@	 NA	34	23	NA	13
geneX#   23	25.6	29.4	13.2	NA   </pre> </div>
	</li>
      <li> This is the same file using nothing for missing values:
	<div class="color">
<pre>
gene1	23.4	45.6	  	76	85.6
genW@	  	34	23	  	13
genX#	23	25.6	29.4	13.2	     </pre> </div>
      </li>
      <li> This is the same file using nothing for missing values and
      a first row with array identifiers:
	<div class="color">
<pre>
#name   s1      s2      s3      s4      s5
gene1	23.4    45.6            76	85.6
genW@	        34	23	        13
genX#	23	25.6    29.4    13.2	     </pre> </div>
      </li>

	  
	<li>Beware that <b>some spreadsheet programs (such as
	Excel)</b> will give you a lot of headaches if you use nothing
	as a missing value code when the missing values are at the end
	of the row. That is because for those lines or rows those
	programs truncate the row at the last valid observation (i.e.,
	they discard the last trailing tabulators that separate empty
	space), so you will have a file where different rows have
	different number of values. And Pomelo will rightfully
	complain and will not run. 
	For example, the last file, if it came from Excel, would
	probably have five columns in the last row (and not six
	columns, as it should), and Pomelo would give you an error
	message and stop till you fix it.  Solutions? Use NA for
	passing missing values to Pomelo, or do not pass those
	files through spreadsheets.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><a name=toc18>Data format for class labels and censored indicators</a></h3>
    <p>Separate values by tab (\t), and finish the file with a carriage return or newline. 
      No missing values are allowed here. Class labels can be anything you wish; they
    can be integers, they can be words, whatever. Of course, if you are using regression or
    Cox model, your dependent variable must be a number. And if you are using a t-test
    there can only be two classes.</p> 
    <p> This is a simple example of class labels file:
    </p>
	<div class="color">
<pre>
CL1     CL2     CL1     CL4	CL2     CL2      CL1      CL4
</pre>	</div>      
    <h3><a name=toc19>Data format for Fisher's exact test on contingency tables</a></h3>
    <p>The <b>class labels</b>, as above, can be any arbitrary coding. The values in the 
      <b>covariate</b> data file should be consecutive integers that start at 0 (i.e., do <b>NOT</b>
      use negative intergers, or you'll get errors). This is an example
      file:</p>
	<div class="color">
<pre>
#gene     c1      c1      c2      c2      c3      c3
gene1	   0	   0	   1	   1	   1	   0	
gene2	   NA	   2 	   NA	   1	   0	   0	
gene3	   NA	   1	   2	   NA	   0	   0	
gene4	   1	   1	   2	   2	   2	   0	
gene5	   1	   0	   0	   2	   1	   2	
gene6	   2	   1	   1	   2	   0	   0	
gene7	   2	   1	   1   	   0	   2	   0	
gene8	   2	   2	   0	   0	   NA	   NA</pre> </div>
    <p>As you can see, most of these rows would yield (if we used the first row as
      the class labels) 3x2 tables or 3x3 tables (e.g., 3rd or 5th rows). </p>

   <h3><a name=toc20>Data format for paired indicator</a></h3>
   <p>The format should be the same as for class labels, except that we will place 
      the same integer at the places where the two paired subjects are. We can choose 
      any integer we want. 
   </p>
   <p>   
      This is a simple example of a paired indicator file:
   </p>
	<div class="color">
<pre>
4	32	4	8	32	8	122	122
</pre> </div>
    <p>In the example file, the first and the third subject are paired (integer used 4, 
       although we could have used any other), the second subject is associated to the fifth
       (integer used 32) and so on.
    </p>

   <h3><a name=toc21>Data format for additional covariables</a></h3>
   <p>Each row of the file represents a subject and each column an additional covariable.
      The format must be as follows: tab (\t) separated fields, a first row with the names 
      of the columns (covariables) and the following rows with each subject's covariable value.
   </p>
   <p>   
      This is a simple example of a additional covariables file:
   </p>
	<div class="color">
<pre>
Age          Country         Weight
20           Spain           76
46           Germany         100
33           England         88
59           Spain           79
61           England         65
24           Spain           58
80           Germany         90
59           England         72
</pre> </div>
    <p>The order of the subjects <i>must be exactly the same</i> as the order in the expression 
       data file. That means, the covariable values (age, country,...) of the 
       first subject (i.e. row), must belong to the subject in the first column of the 
       expression, etc.
    </p>
    <p>The data can be of two types: numeric (age, weight, ...) or non-numeric (country, ...). 
       When the data is read, you will be taken to a page where you will be able to see if 
       it has been read correctly. Be careful, if your data does not have the correct format,
       it can be <i>incorrectly read</i>, meaning a non-numeric variable can be read as numeric
       or vice versa.      
    </p>

    <p>Once the program has finished running, you will get a table with the output from the
       run and a heatmap.
    </p>
    <p>The results table contains a header indicating the test you have used, number of 
       permutations and which covariables where used (if any).
    </p>
    <p>The table shows an index corresponding to the original ordering
       in the data file, gene names, p-values (undajusted),
       FDR-adjusted p-values, and statistics (and the absolute value of
       the statistic). For Fisher's IxJ tests the columns names statistic
       and abs(statistic) really have no meaning. 
    </p>
    <p>The figure is a heatmap where you can filter how and which genes to plot. 
       For now the color scale goes from yellow to blue (green is the mix of
       yellow and blue); missing values are shown as white.
       Both tables and heatmap are clickable and will take you to a page with
       additional information (our <a href="http://idclight.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter Light</a>, 
       based on <a href="http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter</a>).
    </p>
    <p>If you have run an "Anova, linear models (limma)" test, the output will also contain
       a Class compare section containing a button. By clicking on the button we will be 
       taken to a class compare page, where we will be able to compare classes individually. 
    </p>

    <p>The observed test statistics are:
	<dl>
	  <dt>t-test (Permutations)</dt> <dd>The difference of means divided by the
	  square root of the sum of the sample variances of each of
	  the means. (So just the usual <em>t</em> for the unequal
	  variance case).</dd>
	  <dt>Anova (Permutations)</dt><dd>The usual <em>F-statistic</em> (mean squares model/mean 
	      squares error).</dd>

   <a href="mailto:ermorrissey%%cnio.es">Edward Morrissey</a>
   (substitute the "%%" by "@"). All of the multiple testing functions

   based on Westfall & Young (1993) or the documentation for the
   <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/html/multtest.html">"multtest"
   package</a> for R, some inspiration has been obtained from the
   above package (and a lot of testing has been done using multtest
   as a benchmark). Moreover, we have taken C code
   from <a href="http://www.R-project.org/"> R</a> for fitting the
   Cox model (coxfit2.c) and Fisher's exact tests
   (<a name="mehta">fexact.c</a>; the latter is based on Mehta and
   Patel's algorithm). We have also used the GNU scientific
   library, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/gsl"> GSL</a>.
