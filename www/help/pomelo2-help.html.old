<b>(Or, for old-time Pomelo users: Why you should switch to Pomelo II)</b>

<p>Pomelo II is a new and much improved incarnation of Pomelo, a tool for
finding differentially expressed genes, and genes that are of potential
interest because they are related to an outcome of interest (e.g., type of
cancer, survival).</p>

<p>The main features that differentiate Pomelo II from its ancestor, Pomelo,
are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Much faster than Pomelo. The underlying C++ code has now been
    parallelized for the permutation computations. For the longer problems
    you can expect up to a 40 to 60 (or 90 to 110, depending on the hardware
    where we are running Pomelo II) fold increase in speed. Whenever you run
    Pomelo II you will be using between about 60 (or 120) CPUs
  simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Customizable heatmaps for the results that include a dendrogram of the
    displayed genes. This allows "similar genes" to be grouped together in
    the figures, thus simplifying interpretation.  You select the genes to
    plot based on different criteria (unadjusted p-value, FDR-adjusted
    p-value, ...).</li>
  <li>If you use any of the currently standard identifiers for your gene IDs
    for either human, mouse, or rat genomes, you can obtain additional
    information by clicking on the names in the output tables and figures.
    This information is based on that provided by our <a
    href="http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es">IDConverter</a> tool.</li>
  <li>Tables of results are now sortable according to different criteria
    (unadjusted p-value, FDR-adjusted p-value, ...).</li>
  <li>New non-permutation methods have been added (t-limma, anova-limma and
    paired t-limma).</li>
  <li>It is now possible to use additional covariables (with anova-limma). 
    That is, you can now add more information, such as: subject
    age, sex, country, or any other characteristic that might vary expression
    data.</li>
  <li>We now only provide FDR-adjusted p-values (see below).</li>
</ul>

<a name="toc3">FDR and adjusted p-values</a></div>

<div id="results" class="results_box">
<br>


<div class="actual_text">
<p>So as to control multiple testing effects, we provide FDR-adjusted
p-values, which we calculate using the approach of <b>Benjamini &amp;
Hochberg</b> (1995; J. Royal Statistical Society B, 57:289-300).
FWER-correction is no longer provided. We think that control of the FDR
(False Discovery Rate) is probably more relevant for most genomic and
proteomics research than control of the FWER (Family-Wise Error Rate); in
addition, use of the maxT FWER control procedure requires that the subset
pivotality assumption holds, which is not the case with some of the tests
available in Pomelo.</p>

<p>Finally, even if the assumptions of the Benjamini and Hochberg's FDR
procedure are not satistified, the error is often small (Reiner, A., D.
Yekutieli, and Y. Benjamini, 2003, "Identifying differentially expressed
genes using false discovery rate controlling procedures", Bioinformatics 19,
368-375) and, overall, this method is competitive to other alternatives such
as Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli's or permutation-based approaches.</p>

<p>More extensive details on hypothesis testing and multiple testing
correction are provided in the <a

I</a>.</p>

<a name="toc10">Tests available</a></div>

<div id="results" class="results_box">
<br>


<div class="actual_text">
<h3><a name="toc5"></a><a name="t.test">t-test (Permutations)</a></h3>

<p>The all-famous t-test. Used to compare an interval variable (one where
distances between levels make sense) between two groups. For example, we
could compare gene expression data between two types of patients. We use here
the test statistic for the case where we do not assume equal variances in the
two groups. We compute the usual t-statistic, but p-values are obtained by
permutation testing.</p>

<h3><a name="toc6"></a><a name="Anova">Anova (Permutations)</a></h3>

<p>Analysis of variance. We compare between more than two groups the value of
an interval data, such as the gene expression among five types of cancer. The
statistic is your usual ANOVA F-ratio and p-values are obtained using a
permutation test.</p>

<h3><a name="toc7"></a><a name="Regression">Regression (Permutations)</a></h3>

<p>Linear regression. We try to predict the (interval scaled) values of a
dependent variable based on the values of an independent, interval scaled
variable. A typical example is predicting the expression levels of a protein
using gene expression data. (Thus, note here that the "independent" variable
is gene expression). We compute the usual ordinary least-squares regression
coefficient and obtain the p-value using a permutation test.</p>

<h3><a name="toc8"></a><a name="contigency.table">FisherIxJ</a></h3>

<p>Non permutation method for contingency tables. It obtains the unadjusted
p-value using Fisher's exact test. This test would be the one to use if we
have, say, different classes of patients (e.g., six types of cancers) and for
a set of 1000 markers we can have either presence/absence of each marker in
each patient (this would yield 1000 contingency tables of dimensions 6x2
---each marker by each cancer type), or we can have several levels of
(unordered) expression, say four types of expression (which would yield 1000
6x4 tables).</p>

<p>If the markers have more than two levels of expression and these are
ordered (say, from less to more) other tests could be more powerful, such as
the Cochran-Armitage test (which we have not implemented). Another
alternative with categorical response data are logistic and multinomial
models (which we have not implemented).</p>

<p>Please note that FisherIxJ is a test that is rarely used, almost never
with gene-expression arrays. We implemented FisherIxJ for some people who
were using tissue arrays (that yielded pressence/absence values).</p>
</div>

<div class="actual_text">
<h3><a name="toc91" id="toc91"></a><a name="Cox" id="Cox">Cox model</a></h3>

<p>A widely used model for survival data. With survival data we often have
censored observations (e.g., a patient that is not yet dead, and all we know
is that it lived for at least 100 days after initiation of the treatment).</p>

<p>Currently, the Cox model included here works with interval-scaled
covariates; if you pass it a categorical covariate, it can ONLY have two
possible values; otherwise, you will get meaningless results (it will be
treated as an interval scaled covariate).</p>

<p>The Cox model implemented only works with right-censored observations, not
left-censored or doubly-censored ones. As well, it is of course your
responsibility to make sure that assumptions about censoring (e.g., lifetimes
and censoring times are independent, etc) are reasonable. Statistics and
p-values are computed in the "usual way"; the statistic we return is the Wald
statistic and the p-value is from a Wald test.</p>

<h3><a name="toc101" id="toc101"></a><a name="t-test (limma)"
id="t-test (limma)">t-test (limma)</a></h3>

<p>The limma t-test is a non-permutation method used to compare gene
expression data between two groups. When performing a test on one particular
gene, this test borrows information from all the other genes to obtain better
estimates of the variance, using an empirical bayes method.</p>

<p><a name="merging" id="merging">Please note that all three limma-based
tests make several assumptions; most of them are fairly reasonable and seem
to hold in practice. However, notice that, for the empirical bayes procedure
to work, it is assumed that the error variance of all genes comes from the
same distribution; this assumption is clearly violated if the expression
levels for different genes are the result of <i>merging (averaging) over
different number of spots</i>. For instance, if you plan to use the
limma-based tests, you <i>do not want to use merge in </i></a><a
href="http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es">preP</a> if the number of replicates per
gene (or clone) is different among genes (clones).</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="Paired t-test (limma)" id="Paired t-test (limma)">Paired t-test
(limma)</a></h3>

<p>This test is the same test as the limma t-test, but it is to be used when
samples are paired. If samples are paired, you will want to use a paired
t-test (or a <a href="#linear_model">linear model, as explained below</a>).
Suppose we want to perform a t-test to compare tumor vs non-tumor samples
from the same subjects. Each of the samples belonging to the same person
should be similar, as they are from the same subject and, of course, the
samples are naturally paired (each pair tumor/non-tumor comes from the same
subject). By using a paired t-test, we take pairing into account decreasing
the variance of our estimates (generally, taking pairing into account leads
to smaller estimates of the error variance, and thus larger test
statistics).</p>

<p>Pairing comes in many forms and flavors. In general, you have pairing
whenever there is a feature of your design or sampling scheme that leads to
pairs of your two conditions to share some (generally random) characteristic.
This shared characteristic will lead to the pairs showing correlation in
expression. For instance, in the two samples from the same subject example,
each pair of samples shares that they come from the same subject, where the
subject characteristics themselves are not something that interest us <i>per
se</i>, but will induce a correlation between the two observations in the
same subject. Similarly, if we sample families, and we choose pairs of
siblings, one with cancer and one without, we have again pairing (brothers or
sisters are likely to resemble each other by virtue of them being, well,
brothers/sisters). Another example of pairing would arise if we take samples
from two cell lines every hour. If there are any circadian patterns in gene
expression, then the two samples (one from each cell line) at each hour will
show correlated gene expression; thus, the two samples from every hour are
paired, and the data ought to be analyzed with a paired t-test.</p>

<p>Please, see <a href="#merging">caveat about merging</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="toc12" id="toc12"></a><a name="Anova, linear models (limma)"
id="Anova, linear models (limma)">Anova, linear models (limma)</a></h3>

<p>Non permutation method used to compare gene expression data between two or
more groups. Linear models are a more general type of models that include, as
particular cases, ANOVA and multiple regression. We use here the
functionality provided by limma, and thus return empirical bayes adjusted
estimates (i.e., we use information from all genes to obtain better estimates
of variances).</p>

<p>Once the test results have been calculated (i.e., after obtaining the
F-statistic and associated p-value for the test of global differences between
groups), this method gives us the option to individually compare classes
(t-test) and draw venn diagrams with the class comparisons.</p>

<a name="toc3">Limma tests vs permutation tests</a></div>

<div id="results" class="results_box">
<br>


<div class="actual_text">
<p>With permutation tests we obtain the p-value by comparing the observed
statistic (e.g., the observed t-statistic) from our data against a null
distribution obtained from the actual data themselves (e.g., we randomly
permute the class labels, and compute the t-statistic for the permuted data,
and we repeat this, for instance, 50000 times, so that we can obtain the null
distribution of the statistic under the hypothesis that the class labels were
assigned randomly, regardless of gene expression).</p>

<p>In contrast, when using limma we use the standard distributions for
computing the p-values (i.e., we compare the observed t-statistic agains the
expected t-statistic under the null hypothesis by comparing with the
t-distribution with a given degrees of freedom). As explained above, limma
does not directly compute the t-statistic with the usual formula, but rather
uses a "moderated statistic", where the estimate of the variance for every
gene is "moderated" using information from all other genes. This is done
using a specific model for the variances with an empirical bayes procedure as
explained in <a href="http://www.statsci.org/smyth/pubs/ebayes.pdf">Smyth, G.
K. (2004). Linear models and empirical Bayes methods for assessing
differential expression in microarray experiments. Statistical Applications
in Genetics and Molecular Biology 3, No. 1, Article 3</a>. What you will
notice is that extremely small variances are pulled towards the much more
frequent larger values and extremely larger variances are pulled towards
smaller values. Moderated statistics have been shown repeatedly to work
better (in several senses) with microarray data. The differences are most
noticeable with small sample sizes.</p>

<p>What Pomelo tries to do is "detect" genes that are different using as a
criteria gene expression data difference among two or more classes. Since
<i>most likely our data is not homogeneous </i> (homogeneous meaning all
subjects of the same age, country, ... ), we may find that the differences
due to different classes are "blurred" by other differences.  By using
additional covariables, we can add this information to our study and thus
enable a more complete analysis. (If there is a factor, say age, that
accounts for some relevant portion of the variation in the gene expression
data, but you don't use it in your analyses, then what you are doing is
adding that variation, that is explained by age, to the error term. And,
among other consequences, the larger the error term, the smaller the
statistic).</p>

<p>Although additional covariables can be very useful, if the covariable you
try to add is the same as the class file, pomelo can do nothing with this.
<i>Eg.</i> If you are comparing two classes and you add a covariable
indicating that all subjects of one class are male and all subjects of the
other are female, pomelo has no way of knowing which differences belong to
the covariable and which to the class difference. In this case, sex and class
are completely confounded. Any differences in expression could be explained
either by differences in the class variable you are interested, or by
differences in sex.</p>

<p>Additional covariables can only be used with "Anova, linear models
(limma)".</p>

<h3><a name="toc5">Necessary data files for each test</a></h3>

<p>The files <i>"Gene expression data"</i> and <i>"Class labels or dependent
variable"</i> are required for all tests. Files which are only necessary for
certain tests are: <i>"Censored indicator file"</i> (Cox test), <i>"Paired
indicator file"</i> (paired t-test) and <i>"Additional covariables file"</i>
(optional for anova-limma).</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="covar.file">Gene expression data</a></dt>
    <dd>The file with the expression data (e.g., you microarray data). In
      this file, rows represent variables (generally genes) and columns are
      subjects or arrays. We want to find those variables that are most
      distinctly expressed among groups (e.g., a t-test or Anova) or that are
      most related to, say, survival (e.g., Cox model).</dd>
  <dt><br>
  <a name="class.labels">Class labels</a> or dependent variable</dt>
    <dd>These are generally the class labels (e.g., healthy or affected, or
      different types of cancer) that group the samples, or the survival
      times of patients, or another dependent continuous variable (if
      regression models). In our analyses we want to find which of the genes
      shows differential expression between the classes given here, or if a
      given dependent variable (e.g., survival time, expression of certain
      protein) is significantly related to the expression of some gene.</dd>
  <dt><br>
  <a name="censored.indicator">Censored indicator</a></dt>
    <dd>For survival data only. An observation is censored if the time of
      occurrence of the event (usually death) has not yet been observed. We
      will represent uncensored observations with a 1 (because we have
      observed the time of death) and censored observations with a 0 (meaning
      that the survival time given is only a lower bound).</dd>
  <dt><br>
  <a name="paired.indicator">Paired indicator</a></dt>
    <dd>This file is only necessary for paired t-test. It is used to indicate
      which subjects are paired. Two subjects are paired if they share some
      common characteristic that we think may imply similar gene expression
      traits (e.g., two samples from the same subject would be paired).</dd>
  <dt><br>
  <a name="additional.covariables">Additional covariables</a></dt>
    <dd>You may use this file if you wish to add more information to your
      analysis (such as subject age, weight, ...). You will be offered this
      option after having launched a <i>limma anova test</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="toc7"></a><a name="requirements">Data format for gene expression
data</a></h3>

<p>The file for the gene expression should be formated as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data should conform to the "genes in rows, patients (or classes) in
    columns". In other words, each row of the data file is supposed to
    represent a different gene or variable and we will carry-out <b>one test
    for each row</b>.</li>
  <li>Use tab (\t) as the field separator within rows.</li>
  <li>Use newline (\n) between rows. It is also convenient to finish each
    file with one (\n).</li>
  <li>The first column is assumed to contain the ID information for genes,
    marker, or whatever. This will be used to label the output (but it also
    means that whatever is in the first column is not used in the
  analyses).</li>
  <li>You can have an arbitrary number of rows with comments. These rows must
    always start with an "#".</li>
  <li>Array names: if you want to name your arrays (useful for the output of
    the analyses) do as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Place a line that starts with "#";</li>
      <li>After the "#" put "Name" or "NAME" or "name" (don't say we don't
        give you choices);</li>
      <li>Write the array names (separated by tabs).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>There should be no rows with non-numeric data (except for the comments
    and name rows). In particular, eliminate initial rows that contain things
    such as headers with the IDs of patients.</li>
  <li><b>Missing values</b> can be coded in three different ways: a) as "NA";
    b) with one empty space (i.e., " "); c) as nothing (i.e, simply leave
    these places empty).</li>
  <li>This is a small gene expression data file using "NA" for missing values:
    <div class="color">
    <pre>gene1         23.4        45.6        NA        76        85.6
genW@         NA        34        23        NA        13
geneX#   23        25.6        29.4        13.2        NA   </pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This is the same file using nothing for missing values:

    <div class="color">
    <pre>gene1        23.4        45.6                  76        85.6
genW@                  34        23                  13
genX#        23        25.6        29.4        13.2             </pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>This is the same file using nothing for missing values and a first row
    with array identifiers:

    <div class="color">
    <pre>#name   s1      s2      s3      s4      s5
gene1        23.4    45.6            76        85.6
genW@                34        23                13
genX#        23        25.6    29.4    13.2             </pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Beware that <b>some spreadsheet programs (such as Excel)</b> will give
    you a lot of headaches if you use nothing as a missing value code when
    the missing values are at the end of the row. That is because for those
    lines or rows those programs truncate the row at the last valid
    observation (i.e., they discard the last trailing tabulators that
    separate empty space), so you will have a file where different rows have
    different number of values. And Pomelo will rightfully complain and will
    not run. For example, the last file, if it came from Excel, would
    probably have five columns in the last row (and not six columns, as it
    should), and Pomelo would give you an error message and stop till you fix
    it.  Solutions? Use NA for passing missing values to Pomelo, or do not
    pass those files through spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="toc8">Data format for class labels and censored
indicators</a></h3>

<p>Separate values by tab (\t), and finish the file with a carriage return or
newline. No missing values are allowed here. Class labels can be anything you
wish; they can be integers, they can be words, whatever. Of course, if you
are using regression or Cox model, your dependent variable must be a number.
And if you are using a t-test there can only be two classes.</p>

<p>This is a simple example of class labels file:</p>

<div class="color">
<pre>CL1     CL2     CL1     CL4        CL2     CL2      CL1      CL4</pre>
</div>

<h3><a name="toc9">Data format for Fisher's exact test on contingency
tables</a></h3>

<p>The <b>class labels</b>, as above, can be any arbitrary coding. The values
in the <b>gene expression</b> data file should be consecutive integers that start
at 0 (i.e., do <b>NOT</b> use negative intergers, or you'll get errors). This
is an example file:</p>

<div class="color">
<pre>#gene     c1      c1      c2      c2      c3      c3
gene1           0           0           1           1           1           0        
gene2           NA           2            NA           1           0           0        
gene3           NA           1           2           NA           0           0        
gene4           1           1           2           2           2           0        
gene5           1           0           0           2           1           2        
gene6           2           1           1           2           0           0        
gene7           2           1           1              0           2           0        
gene8           2           2           0           0           NA           NA</pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, most of these rows would yield (if we used the first row
as the class labels) 3x2 tables or 3x3 tables (e.g., 3rd or 5th rows).</p>

<h3><a name="toc9">Data format for paired indicator</a></h3>

<p>The format should be the same as for class labels, except that we will
place the same integer at the places where the two paired subjects are. We
can choose any integer we want.</p>

<p>This is a simple example of a paired indicator file:</p>

<div class="color">
<pre>4        32        4        8        32        8        122        122</pre>
</div>

<p>In the example file, the first and the third subject are paired (integer
used 4, although we could have used any other), the second subject is
associated to the fifth (integer used 32) and so on.</p>

<h3><a name="toc9">Data format for additional covariables</a></h3>

<p>Each row of the file represents a subject and each column an additional
covariable. The format must be as follows: tab (\t) separated fields, a first
row with the names of the columns (covariables) and the following rows with
each subject's covariable value.</p>

<p>This is a simple example of a additional covariables file:</p>

<div class="color">
<pre>Age          Country         Weight
20           Spain           76
46           Germany         100
33           England         88
59           Spain           79
61           England         65
24           Spain           58
80           Germany         90
59           England         72</pre>
</div>

<p>The order of the subjects <i>must be exactly the same</i> as the order in
the expression data file. That means, the covariable values (age,
country,...) of the first subject (i.e. row), must belong to the subject in
the first column of the expression, etc.</p>

<p>The data can be of two types: numeric (age, weight, ...) or non-numeric
(country, ...). When the data is read, you will be taken to a page where you
will be able to see if it has been read correctly. Be careful, if your data
does not have the correct format, it can be <i>incorrectly read</i>, meaning
a non-numeric variable can be read as numeric or vice versa. If this happens
<em>all further analyses will be wrong!</em></p>

<p>Once the program has finished running, you will get a table with the
output from the run and a heatmap.</p>

<p>The results table contains a header indicating the test you have used,
number of permutations and which covariables where used (if any).</p>

<p>The table shows an index corresponding to the original ordering in the
data file, gene names, p-values (undajusted), FDR-adjusted p-values, and
statistics (and the absolute value of the statistic). For Fisher's IxJ tests
the columns names statistic and abs(statistic) really have no meaning.</p>

<p>The figure is a heatmap where you can filter how and which genes to plot.
For now the color scale goes from yellow to blue (green is the mix of yellow
and blue); missing values are shown as white. Both tables and heatmap are
clickable and will take you to a page with additional information (our <a
