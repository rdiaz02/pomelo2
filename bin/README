This is the (only) help for the usage of the stand-alone Pomelo II:


USAGE:
multest test maxT/minP nperm covariate_data class_data censored_data
      test:  type of test; one of:
      FisherIxJ: minP Fisher's exact test for IxJ contingency "
                       tables (I, J >= 2);
      t:         t-test (welch's);
      Anova:     ANOVA;
      Cox:       Cox regression (survival analysis);
      Regres:    linear regression;
      maxT/minP:      this makes no difference; we use FDR now.
      nperm:          number of permutations
      covariate_data: rows are genes, columns are conditions.
