Go to the next directory, make the binary
(make)
and copy the binary executable here (do not forget this step!)


You need to have OpenMPI installed (the makefile will try calling mpiCC)
to compile. (We used to use LAM MPI, but not anymore. And this probably
might work with other MPIs, but we have not tested).



NOTE: in 2016-03-02 I am getting issues with the newest openmpi for
debian, 1.10.2-8. It seems that the link libmpi.so.1 is no longer
present. I manually ln -s to libmpi.so. But this seems ugly. I do not have
time to debug it now.


This is the (only) help for the usage of the stand-alone Pomelo II:


USAGE:

(Actually, use mpirun explicitly so do
mpirun -np somenumber multest_paral and the rest of the arguments)

multest test maxT/minP nperm covariate_data class_data censored_data
      test:  type of test; one of:
      FisherIxJ: minP Fisher's exact test for IxJ contingency "
                       tables (I, J >= 2);
      t:         t-test (welch's);
      Anova:     ANOVA;
      Cox:       Cox regression (survival analysis);
      Regres:    linear regression;
      maxT/minP:      this makes no difference; we use FDR now. minP will
      		      not work (give weird results)
      
      nperm:          number of permutations
      covariate_data: rows are genes, columns are conditions.
      class_data:     classification or dependent variable, regression, Cox).
      [censored_data]: if survival data, the censoring indicator.



EXAMPLES:

You can use the files under /www/Examples/Data. I will use here 10000
permutations and 64 processes on a single machine. Other calls are
possible using a hostfile, etc. Consult the mpirun documentation.


mpirun -np 64 multest_paral t maxT 10000 LeukExpr LeukClass

mpirun -np 64 multest_paral Anova maxT 10000 BreastExpr BreastClass

Yeah, this is meaningless, but is to test it
mpirun -np 64 multest_paral Regres maxT 10000 BreastExpr BreastClass


mpirun -np 64 multest_paral Cox maxT 10000 CoxExpr CoxSurv CoxCensor


mpirun -np 64 multest_paral FisherIxJ maxT 10000 FisherExData FisherExLabels
