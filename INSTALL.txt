POMELO2 INSTALL GUIDE

Place the pomelo2 folder wherever you want pomelo2 to live.
Run the install_pomelo2.py and follow the instructions you are given.


REQUIREMENTS

Go to the Asterias project page (http://bioinformatics.org/asterias) for
further details. You definitely need:

- Python (>= 2.4)
- LAM/MPI


You can run Pomelo II standalone (i.e., just the C++, not the complete
web-based application). This of course only provides you with some of the
available tests in the full Pomelo II, and none of the useful figures, but
you can do it. Go to the /bin directory and follow instructions there.



INSTALLATION
- For now, in the Pomelo2_html_templates you will need to substitute the
URL in all places.
